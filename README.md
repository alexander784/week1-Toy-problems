  <h2>Description</h2>

 <p>Define the gradeCalculator function with the student's marks as an argument to get the corresponding grade.</p>

        function calculateGrade(){
       let marks = parseFloat(prompt(`Enter student marks (between 0 and 100):`));


      

   <p>You Â input student marks into an JavaScript function, and it will determine the relevant grades based on the following requirements: </p>

            A: Greater than 79
            B: 60 to 79
            C: 50 to 59
            D: 40 to 49
            E: Less than 40

<h2>Look at the JavaScript Grade Calculator Function:</h2>
<br>

       function calculateGrade(){

     let marks = parseFloat(prompt(`Enter student marks (between 0 and 100):`));

     let grade; 

    if (marks > 79){
    grade = "A";
     }else if (marks>= 60){
    grade = "B"
    }else if (marks >= 50) {
    grade = "C"
    }else if(marks>= 40) {
    grade ="D"

    }else{
    grade = "E"
    }


     console.log(`The student's grade is: ${grade}`);

    }

    // Output Calculated grade

    console.log(`The student's grade is: ${grade}`);
}




<h3>Invoke the function to calculate and display the grade</h3>
